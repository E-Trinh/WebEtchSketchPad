# Web Etch Sketch Pad
This project was completed for one of the assigned projects in The Odin Project: [Link to The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)
Allows users to sketch on a grid. The number of rows and columns in the grid can be specified by the user. When sketching on the grid, colors are randomly selected. This application uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The goal of this project was to practice DOM manipulation using Javascript on the index.HTML file. CSS was used for styling and alignment of elements.
